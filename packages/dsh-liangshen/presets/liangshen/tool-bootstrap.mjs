/**
 * Keep the first model request on a minimal-shaped input surface, then expose
 * the full preset catalog once the session is safely anchored.
 *
 * Phase 1 (no persisted `tool/call` yet):
 * - tool catalog: one platform shell plus `commonTools`
 * - prompt sections: only the persona section (all other sections,
 *   including plan-mode's `plan:policy`, return after promotion)
 * - runtime contexts: emptied (no sandbox/approval snapshot)
 * - pre-step messages: only whitelisted source kinds pass (direct user
 *   messages and goal auto-rounds by default)
 *
 * Promotion opens the full tool catalog and restores runtime contexts and all
 * prompt sections. With `anchorGate` the promotion after the first tool call
 * also requires one minimal-like reasoning block (a first block containing
 * `we` and no `let me`) or the `maxBootstrapSteps` fallback.
 * `promoteAfterFirstResponse` promotes a tool-less first response once it has
 * responded, and also releases an anchor-gated session when its first turn
 * ends (`turn/end`). With `promotedPresentation: code` the promoted catalog
 * is presented as PTC Mode: the wire shows a single `run_code` tool
 * backed by the generated SDK, switched at the step boundary so the current
 * step's native calls are never interrupted. `deferredSources` and
 * `deferredGraceSteps` delay selected injected message kinds (workspace
 * instructions, skill catalog) for a few steps after promotion.
 *
 * COMPACTION (local addition, ported from the upstream compaction-epoch
 * semantics): a compaction rewrites the whole model-visible surface, so the
 * first post-compaction request is a "second first request". A
 * `compaction/end` event releases PTC Mode (the presentation disposer) and
 * resets the promotion state to the CONTROLLED phase — bootstrap pair plus
 * `compactionTools` (a core work set, default none) — until a NEW durable
 * promotion signal exists past that boundary. The reset lives both in the
 * live `session/event` path and inside the durable-log scan, so resume and
 * reload reconstruct the same phase.
 *
 * ROBUSTNESS: composition drift (a missing bootstrap shell or common tool)
 * degrades to the full catalog with a one-time warning instead of throwing,
 * so a broken composition can never lock a session out of every request.
 *
 * OPT-IN PHASE-1 INSTRUCTION (issue #274): `phase1FirstCallInstruction` is
 * an optional string appended to the phase-1 persona; unset (the default)
 * keeps the phase-1 persona the exact one-line Minimal anchor. Test builds
 * use it to ask the model to ground its first answer with one Minimal-native
 * tool call before responding, so first-turn capability questions are
 * answered from the promoted registry instead of the cropped two-tool view.
 *
 * Source: https://github.com/xiaobright/dsh-anchored-standard (MIT), extended
 * with the phase-1 quarantine and the stabilization controls above.
