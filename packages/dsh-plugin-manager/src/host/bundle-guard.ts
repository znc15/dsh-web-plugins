/**
 * Post-mutation duplicate-mount guard for the gateway host half. The official
 * CLI's bundle reconciliation appends EVERY dependency that declares
 * `dsh.bundle` to the profile manifest's `dsh.profile.bundles` — including
 * packages the composition already mounts through a patch row (the family
 * aggregate mounts dsh-better-sidebar as the insert row
 * `{ id: 'better-sidebar', name: 'dsh-better-sidebar' }` while the package
 * also sits in the profile's dependencies). The bundles layer then mounts the
 * package a second time and the next boot dies on duplicate routes
 * (`webserver: duplicate prefix route "/sidebar/api"`). This module decides,
 * from the before-state composition, which newly added bundles entries are
 * such duplicate mounts; the gateway strips exactly those entries back out.
 * @module @linxin666/dsh-client-ui-plugin-manager/host
