# dsh-git-graph

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

External dsh Web GUI plugin: a **git branch selector** and **Git graph** panel. The selector appears only in blank sessions, in the context hole of the official input selector row (`conversation.input.selector.context`, a session-maybe list slot) next to the official workspace selector pill. If the running shell does not declare that slot (the npm SDK rc.6 removed it), it waits `CONTEXT_FALLBACK_MS` then falls back to `conversation.input.dock`; in its blank-session hero phase the chip lifts into the official hero row immediately after the agent-preset seat, using the same transparent 28px pill recipe and `--dsw-*` theme tokens as the official workspace and preset chips. Active sessions expose no branch-selection control. Git capabilities run in the host process (checkout-tree `git switch`) and the UI is browser React; workspace selection remains the official entry.

Behavior aligns with ZCode's `GitBranchSwitcher`: searchable popover, a checkmark on the current item, bottom actions "创建并检出新分支… / Git 图谱" (Create and check out new branch… / Git graph), a switch guard (unresolved conflicts / an operation in progress / the target branch checked out by another worktree) and readable errors.

## Repository layout and build

Kept as a sibling of the DeepSeek Harness main repo (sibling checkout, same turtle-ui layout; the path is arbitrary, below is only an example):

```text
~/code/deepseek-harness   # deepseek-harness checkout (sibling)
~/code/dsh-git-graph      # this repository
```

All peer APIs come from the sibling checkout's source (tsconfig resolves via the paths of `../deepseek-harness/tsconfig.base.json`; when the sibling directory has a different name, replace the `../deepseek-harness` relative path in the tsconfig files with the actual directory). The type gate is `pnpm run typecheck` (`tsc -b`, which also builds the sibling packages referenced by `references`, writing declaration artifacts into the sibling's `lib/` — the same design as turtle-ui).

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run typecheck   # tsc -b (including sibling referenced projects)
pnpm test            # vitest (core pure functions / real git service / jsdom components)
pnpm run build       # tsc -b && tsdown (lib/index.js + lib/invariant.js + lib/client.js)
```

`lib/client.js` is the browser bundle (a closure-factory artifact, `window.__ModuleLoader__.load`), served by the host's client-modules at `/plugins/<id>/client.js`; the build presets `build/tsdown.client.ts` + `build/web/src/platform.ts` are copies taken from the main repo's `packages/client/tsdown.client.ts` / `packages/client/web/src/platform.ts`, and must be kept in sync when the main repo changes.

Git installs (consumer machines without a sibling checkout) go through the `prepare` script: `tsdown --config tsdown.prepare.config.ts` transpiles directly from src without type checking (`tsconfig.prepare.json` is self-contained).

## Activation

This package is a dsh profile bundle (`package.json` declares `"dsh": { "bundle": { "patch": "./cordis.patch.yml" } }`). After activation, the next `dsh web` (or corresponding profile) startup has the bundle patch's insert line mount `ui-git-graph` (host half: git service + `/git/*` routes) together with the browser half (dsh.client declaration) into the Web composition; after a page refresh, the branch pill appears in the hero row after the agent-preset seat for a blank session and is absent from an active session.

### Generic install (any machine)

This plugin is merged into the dsh-web family monorepo (`github.com/zhu1090093659/dsh-web`). The plugin is published to npm; one-line install recommended:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @linxin666/dsh-client-ui-git-graph@latest
```

Or install the family aggregate package `@linxin666/dsh-web-all` all at once (same one-line `dsh plugin --profile web add @linxin666/dsh-web-all@latest`).

Install from the repository when you need to debug code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zhu1090093659/dsh-web.git
cd dsh-web
pnpm install && pnpm -r build
dsh plugin --profile web add link:$(pwd)/packages/dsh-git-graph
```

> The `github:` install form applies to a standalone repo whose package sits at the repository root (the `prepare` script builds self-contained; pnpm ≥10 rejects it the first time, add the package key to the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `allowBuilds` per the printed error and retry). For subpackages of a monorepo use the `link:` form above.

### Local development loop (this repo checkout)

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <name> add link:/absolute/path/to/dsh-git-graph
```

A `link:` install references the local directory directly; a rebuild takes effect immediately without reinstalling (after a code change, `pnpm run build` then refresh the page). Note that `link:` takes an absolute path (`~` is expanded by the shell, not by pnpm semantics).

## Uninstall

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove @linxin666/dsh-client-ui-git-graph
```

## Design notes

- Boundary and load-chain research and key decisions: see [docs/ADR-001-plugin-boundary.md](docs/ADR-001-plugin-boundary.md).
- The host half's `/git/*` only accepts paths of registered workspaces (realpath check) and trusted clients (loopback socket + loopback Host, the same fence as dsh-ssh, plus a live paired-device cookie when `dsh-remote-web-ui` is loaded); the browser cannot run git against arbitrary directories, and a LAN-exposed dsh web answers unpaired non-loopback clients with 403.
- The switch semantics are workspace-level: `git switch --no-guess <branch>` operates on the repoRoot checkout tree and affects all sessions of that workspace; project switch = activate the target workspace and open its (reused or newly created) blank session, without changing the cwd of existing sessions.
- Mount seam: `conversation.input.selector.context` (the officially declared session-maybe list slot) is the context hole of the input selector row beside the official workspace pill. The branch pill renders only for blank sessions and hides when there is no session cwd or the workspace is not a Git repository. Declaration-aware fallback waits `CONTEXT_FALLBACK_MS` for that slot (the npm SDK rc.6 shell removed its declaration); if no declaration arrives, it mounts on `conversation.input.dock` for the blank-session hero phase. There the chip re-anchors into the official hero row after the agent-preset seat (2px row gap, vertically centered, with matching workspace/preset chip metrics and tokens) and opens its picker downward like the official workspace menu. Active sessions have no branch-selection control. Only one seat is mounted, and late context declarations after the fallback are ignored.
- Workspace selection is not inside this plugin: the official workspace pill (`conversation.input.selector.workspace`) is the only entry; this plugin only provides git branch context.
- Branch state refresh: fetch when the blank-session chip mounts / the popover opens / a switch succeeds, plus host SSE (`/git/events`, polling workspace state every 30s while subscribed, each probe bounded by a 15s deadline so a hung git never stalls the stream) pushing external changes and a window-focus refresh (throttled to once per 5s). Active sessions do not subscribe. The SSE stream is shared across tabs through a cross-tab leader relay (Web Locks + BroadcastChannel): one stream per URL browser-wide, so extra tabs never exhaust the same-origin HTTP connection pool (#383).

## Check chain

```sh
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm run build
```

## Telemetry

The browser half sends one anonymous install heartbeat per UTC day to dsh-market.com: a random localStorage id plus this package's name, nothing else. The server stores only a salted hash of that id, never IP addresses, and exposes aggregate counts only. See [docs/telemetry.md](../../docs/telemetry.md) for the full contract.
