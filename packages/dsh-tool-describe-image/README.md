# dsh-tool-describe-image — Image Understanding Tool Plugin

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Model-facing `describe_image` tool: gives **text-only models** (DeepSeek V4 etc.) image understanding.
Each call loads one image — a local file path, an http(s) URL, or a session attachment reference —
and asks a vision endpoint (Qwen-VL, GLM-4V, GPT-4o, Claude-style endpoints such as OpenCode Go,
a local Ollama endpoint…) to answer over the Chat Completions, Responses, or Anthropic Messages
protocol; **only the returned text enters the conversation, the image itself never enters the session log**.

Ported from deepseek-harness `packages/vision/tool-describe-image` (mirrored at
[whitelonng/dsh-plugin-describe-image](https://github.com/whitelonng/dsh-plugin-describe-image)),
adapted to the dsh-web family conventions: official NPM SDK only, host-side plugin with a
browser half, live settings, no dsh source changes.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Three inputs | Local absolute path, http(s) URL (redirects refused), a complete `[image attachment ...]` note, or the complete self-contained Markdown reference a drag/paste produces (`![图片](/describe-image/raw/sha256:...?ref=...)`). Pass the complete Markdown reference to the tool: its serialized immutable metadata resolves the stored image after a host restart and in PTC nested tool calls; a bare id remains a current-process fallback |
| Direct image send | Dragging or pasting an image into a text-only session is rewritten at send time into a self-contained describe-image reference (`![图片](/describe-image/raw/sha256:...?ref=...)`) instead of an image block the model cannot read, so the image renders in the conversation and the model analyzes it through the tool. Models whose adapter declares the image input modality are detected automatically: the raw image blocks reach the model's own vision, no describe_image detour happens, and the `describe_image` tool is hidden from that session — the multimodal model neither sees nor can call it (including nested calls from run_code) |
| Custom instructions | The `prompt` argument carries your precise instruction (OCR, chart reading, UI diagnosis, translation…); the `defaultPrompt` config sets the fallback when the model passes none |
| Live config card | Settings → Plugin config → Web UI Plugins → "Image understanding" card edits `baseURL` / `apiStyle` / `model` / API key / default instruction / bounds (through the settings seam); effective immediately, no restart |
| Connection probe | The model field carries a "Fetch models" control and — once the model field holds a value — a "Test connectivity" control, both working before saving. Fetch posts the drafts to `POST /describe-image/models`, which resolves the credential through the key-resolution chain on the host and returns only the model id list; a successful listing proves the endpoint is reachable and the key authenticates, and the model field swaps into a dropdown of the fetched models. Test connectivity pings the selected model with one minimal completion (`max_tokens` 1) and reports the model's own round-trip latency |
| Protocol styles | `apiStyle: chat-completions` (default) posts to `baseURL/chat/completions` and reads `message.content`, falling back to `reasoning_content` when the content is empty (reasoning models such as Kimi K2.x can spend the whole output budget on thinking — issue #637; raise `maxOutputTokens` or use `model:off` to avoid it); `apiStyle: responses` posts to `baseURL/responses` with `input` / `max_output_tokens` and reads `output_text`, including SSE-only endpoints that always stream (`text/event-stream` payloads are parsed automatically); `apiStyle: anthropic-messages` posts to `baseURL/v1/messages` with `x-api-key` auth (Claude-style endpoints such as OpenCode Go, Zhipu GLM, Moonshot Kimi) and reads `content[].text` |
| Thinking control | The model id carries an optional suffix: `model:off` disables thinking, `model:low` / `model:medium` / `model:high` enable it, and a bare `model` sends no control so the endpoint default applies (MiMo-V2.5 and DeepSeek V4 think by default) |
| Raw image route | `GET /describe-image/raw/<id>` serves the stored bytes (loopback-only, content-addressed id) so the pasted reference renders in the conversation |
| Capability route | `GET /describe-image/capability?session=<id>` answers whether the session's model declares image input (the session's own logged request route decides the effective model — a resumed session keeps its logged model, a fresh session without requests takes the current default selection; modalities resolve through `resolveModelInfo`). Every unresolved route, unknown, and failure answers false, preserving the rewrite behavior |
| Native image toggle | rc.8: the settings card's "Native image requests" section reports the current default model's image-input state and toggles the DeepSeek adapter catalog entry (`inputModalities` in the `llm-deepseek` settings namespace) through the loopback route pair `GET` / `POST /describe-image/native-images`. Enabled: sent images reach the model natively and `describe_image` hides from that model's toolset; disabled: the legacy rewrite applies. Hosts without the adapter namespace render the section with an unsupported hint |
| Per-call key resolution | Inline `apiKey` → credential seam (`apiKeyEnv`, default `VISION_API_KEY`) → launch environment, tiered fallback |
| Safety and bounds | All requests refuse redirects; `maxBytes` / `maxOutputTokens` / `timeoutMs` caps; magic-byte type gate; bounded error excerpts (200 chars); keys never logged |
| Canonical return | `{ text, model, image, mimeType, bytes }` — the model only sees `text` |

## Security model

- Vision requests and image downloads both refuse HTTP redirects (`redirect: 'error'`); bearer credentials
  and image bytes never reach a source other than the configured deployment.
- The request body carries the base64 image but no key; request headers and resolved credentials are not logged.
- Only `http(s)` URLs and local paths are accepted; every other URL scheme is rejected.
- The image URL is model-controlled: private, loopback, link-local (cloud metadata), and
  reserved addresses are refused before any connection — literal IPs are judged from the
  normalized URL, domain names after every resolved address is checked, and an unresolvable
  domain fails closed. Rejection messages never echo response statuses or host-internal facts.
- Local file paths are readable only inside the session workspace (the session's canonical
  working directory): `../` traversal and symlinks cannot escape it, and a call carrying no
  session workspace can only use URLs or attachment references.
- The attach route validates base64, magic bytes, and the byte bound before the attachment store
  persists anything; only the reference JSON (text) crosses into the conversation.
- The attach and raw-image routes are loopback-only with the same same-origin fence: the raw
  read serves stored image bytes and the attach POST writes them, so a LAN or cross-site caller
  is turned away before either runs.
- Response bodies are truncated at the cap (`maxOutputTokens * 8 + 64 KiB`) before parsing.
- The model probe's key stays on the host: the browser half only posts the connection
  drafts and receives only the model id list or a latency number; the fetch makes one
  `GET` models listing and the connectivity test one `max_tokens` 1 completion, so a
  test spends a single output token.
- The model probe routes are loopback-only with same-origin checks (the shared
  `host/loopback` fence, same as dsh-ssh): a cross-site page can never steer the
  stored key at an attacker-controlled URL.
- The native-image toggle routes are loopback-only with the same same-origin fence; they write
  only the official `llm-deepseek` model catalog through the host settings seam (revision-fenced,
  validated by the adapter schema) and never touch credentials.

## Installation

Install the family aggregate `@linxin666/dsh-web-all` (all plugins and skins in one package), or this plugin alone:

```sh
# Recommended: install directly from npm
dsh plugin --profile web add @linxin666/dsh-tool-describe-image@latest
```

The aggregate mounts this plugin **without configuration**: loading is unaffected, and the first call
fails with a clear error (`describe-image: baseURL must be an absolute http(s) URL`) until configured.
Fill in the endpoint and model on the "Image understanding" card under Settings → Plugin config to
start immediately, no restart needed. (Difference from upstream: upstream validates eagerly at load;
the family aggregate has no config entry, so validation is eager only when a composition entry
actually configures it and per-call otherwise.)

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `baseURL` | — (required) | Endpoint root; the style appends its path (`/chat/completions`, `/responses`, or `/v1/messages`). OpenAI-compatible examples use e.g. `https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1`; Anthropic style accepts a provider root such as `https://opencode.ai/zen/go`, a conventional `/v1` API root, or a complete `/v1/messages` endpoint. Trailing slashes stripped |
| `apiStyle` | `chat-completions` | Protocol style: `chat-completions` appends `/chat/completions`; `responses` appends `/responses` (OpenAI Responses API `input` / `max_output_tokens` / `output_text` shapes; SSE-only endpoints that always stream are parsed automatically); `anthropic-messages` normalizes the root to one `/v1/messages` endpoint (Claude-style `messages` / `max_tokens` / `content[].text`, `x-api-key` + `anthropic-version` headers) |
| `model` | — (required) | Vision model id, optionally with a thinking suffix (`:off` / `:low` / `:medium` / `:high`). The suffix is stripped before the id reaches the endpoint: `:off` maps to `thinking.type: disabled` (`chat-completions`) or `reasoning.effort: none` (`responses`); every other level maps to `enabled` or is forwarded as the `reasoning.effort` value. No suffix means no thinking control field. The `anthropic-messages` style sends no thinking field and keeps the endpoint's own default |
| `apiKey` | — | Inline key for local debugging; prefer `!!js process.env.VISION_API_KEY` over a hardcoded secret |
| `apiKeyEnv` | `VISION_API_KEY` | Credential reference (environment-variable name); empty string disables reference resolution |
| `defaultPrompt` | see source | The instruction used when a call omits its `prompt` — tune it to your workload (OCR, UI review, translation…) |
| `maxBytes` | `10485760` | Image byte bound (local files and downloads alike) |
| `maxOutputTokens` | `1024` | Output-token cap: `max_tokens` under `chat-completions` and `anthropic-messages`, `max_output_tokens` under `responses` |
| `timeoutMs` | `120000` | Per-call vision request timeout |
| `renderImagePreview` | `true` | Upgrade image references in the conversation into inline thumbnails (click for full size); `false` keeps the raw reference text. Display-only — message text and model-side analysis are unchanged |
| `interceptImageSend` | `true` | Rewrite image-bearing sends at submit into describe-image references; `false` passes image sends through untouched so other vision plugins sharing the session keep the raw image blocks (the text-only-model rewrite must then come from them) |

Configured mount example (profile `cordis.patch.yml` / composition file):

```yaml
- id: describe-image
  name: '@linxin666/dsh-tool-describe-image'
  config:
    baseURL: https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
    model: qwen-vl-max
    apiKey: !!js process.env.VISION_API_KEY
```

Endpoints exposing only the Responses API set `apiStyle: responses`:

```yaml
- id: describe-image
  name: '@linxin666/dsh-tool-describe-image'
  config:
    baseURL: https://api.openai.com/v1
    apiStyle: responses
    model: gpt-4o-mini
    apiKey: !!js process.env.VISION_API_KEY
```

Endpoints whose models enable extended thinking by default (MiMo-V2.5, DeepSeek V4) can turn it off per call so reasoning tokens do not consume the output budget:

```yaml
- id: describe-image
  name: '@linxin666/dsh-tool-describe-image'
  config:
    baseURL: https://api.xiaomimimo.com/v1
    model: mimo-v2.5:off
    apiKey: !!js process.env.VISION_API_KEY
```

Claude-style endpoints (e.g. OpenCode Go, which serves Qwen3.7 Plus and other vision models only
through the Messages API) set `apiStyle: anthropic-messages`; a bare provider root is the simplest `baseURL` form:

```yaml
- id: describe-image
  name: '@linxin666/dsh-tool-describe-image'
  config:
    baseURL: https://opencode.ai/zen/go
    apiStyle: anthropic-messages
    model: qwen3.7-plus
    apiKey: !!js process.env.OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY
```

The provider path is preserved: this example sends the request to `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/messages`.

## Usage

### Custom instructions

The tool takes a `prompt` argument: tell the vision model exactly what you need — "transcribe all
text", "extract the table as CSV", "diagnose the UI layout problems", "translate the text into
Chinese". A targeted instruction beats a generic description; the tool description steers the
text model toward passing one. Calls without a `prompt` fall back to `defaultPrompt`.

### Sending images directly

Text-only models have no image entry in the DSH input box, so drag or paste an image into the
composer: at send time the plugin rewrites the image-bearing send into a self-contained describe-image
reference (`![图片](/describe-image/raw/sha256:...?ref=...)`) instead of an image block the model cannot read.
The bytes travel to the host `/describe-image/attach` route (validated for size and magic bytes, persisted
in the attachment store); only durable reference text enters the session log. The complete reference can be
passed intact to `describe_image` after a host restart or from a PTC nested tool call.
The web shell renders user messages as plain text, so the sent reference would sit in the
transcript as raw markdown; with `renderImagePreview` on (the card's "Render image preview in
chat" toggle, on by default) the client upgrades each reference in place into an inline thumbnail
— click it for a full-size overlay. If the raw route is unreachable through the current origin
(for example behind a proxy that does not forward it), the thumbnail load fails and the reference
text stays as-is.

The rewrite is a live switch — the settings card's "Rewrite image sends into describe-image
references" toggle (`interceptImageSend`, on by default). Turn it off when another vision plugin
shares the session and must receive the raw image blocks itself; sends then pass through
untouched.

### Native image requests (rc.8)

The DeepSeek chat-completions adapter (rc.8) sends image blocks natively when the catalogued
model's `inputModalities` includes `image`; the official model settings UI does not expose that
field. The card's "Native image requests" section covers it: it shows the current default model's
image-input verdict and a toggle that rewrites the `llm-deepseek` settings namespace through the
official settings seam (schema validation, revision fencing, and persistence stay with the host).
Enabled, the default model receives sent images directly and `describe_image` is masked from its
toolset; disabled, the legacy describe-image rewrite applies. Both routes are loopback-only with
the same same-origin fence as the attach routes; the browser never sees credentials.

## Known limitations

- Only the magic-byte gate checks the type; the image is not decoded, so a header-valid but corrupt
  file fails only at the vision endpoint.
- One image per answer: no multi-image input, no follow-up on the previous image, no structured
  output (coordinates / boxes).
- Extracting text still costs one VLM call: OCR-only deployments can point `baseURL` at a cheaper OCR model.
- Three protocol styles: Chat Completions (`/chat/completions`), Responses (`/responses`), and
  Anthropic Messages (`/v1/messages`, `x-api-key` auth). The responses style also parses SSE-only
  endpoints that always stream (`text/event-stream`, e.g. codex-lb style relays); for vendors
  with other request/response shapes, add another adapter.
- The model thinking suffix is a plugin shorthand that adds provider-specific fields
  (`thinking.type` / `reasoning.effort`) to the request; endpoints that do not accept them (for
  example plain OpenAI vision models) should use a bare model id. Chat Completions has no effort
  levels, so `:low` / `:medium` / `:high` all map to `thinking.type: enabled` there. Only the four
  known suffixes are stripped — ids that end in other colon variants (for example OpenRouter
  `:free`) are forwarded verbatim.
