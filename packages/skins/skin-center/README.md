# Skin Center (in-GUI skin center)

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

`@linxin666/dsh-client-ui-skin-center` (cordis plugin id `ui-skin-center`) is the single skin package of the dsh Web GUI: it puts the skin list / try-on / apply into the real GUI as the first-level Skin Center settings section (settings → 皮肤中心, listing only installed skins), and it is the only loader and renderer for skins. A skin is a pure asset directory — no package.json, no npm publish, no cordis wiring — that couples only to the skin-center contract (`contracts/`); the skin center absorbs every official-DSH coupling behind that contract. The card carries its own enable switch (off disables try-on, apply and the background controls).

The management card shows only the enable switch, the "官方默认" (official default) look, Whale Song (鲸吟) and the light/dark theme toggle; the active target carries the Active marker. The catalog reads user skins from `$DSH_HOME/skins/<id>/` and this package ships **no bundled skins** — the whale-song (鲸吟) skin is distributed as an independent skin repository: install it into `$DSH_HOME/skins/whale-song/` and it appears in the catalog. Skins whose `skin.json` fails validation are excluded fail-closed and reported as catalog diagnostics.
- Try-on / Apply: both go through the same atomic switch engine (`src/client/runtime/skin-controller.ts`). One switch is one new activation identity: fetch the scoped stylesheet, install it plus the background media and optional hooks, flip `html[data-dsh-skin="<id>"]`, then dispose the previous activation (append-only effect ledger, idempotent teardown). The latest request always wins; a failed or superseded switch leaves the previous skin fully intact. Try-on is the same switch without persistence — "Exit try-on" restores the committed skin. Apply persists the selection (`POST /api/skin-center/v2/active`). No page reload, no `cordis.patch.yml` rewrite, no boot-graph regeneration.
- First paint: the host half registers one index.html transform (`webServer.tapIndex`, single adapter module `src/tap-index-adapter.ts`) that stamps `html[data-dsh-skin]` and inserts the stylesheet links into every served document, so a reload boots straight into the active skin with no flash of the stock look. The tap fails closed to the stock look on any problem.
- Skin format (v2): `skin.json` (validated fail-closed, v1 fields `package`/`wiring`/`bodyAttr` ignored with migration warnings), `skin.css` (L1 token remaps + L2 semantic selectors), optional `patches.css` (L3 free selectors, high sensitivity), optional `hooks.mjs` (trusted escape hatch, high sensitivity), `assets/`, `preview/`. All CSS passes the safety pipeline (`src/core/css-safety/transform.ts`): every selector is force-scoped under `html[data-dsh-skin]`, `@import` / remote or protocol-relative URLs / escaping paths are hard errors. See `contracts/README.md`.
- Coverage contract: L1 remaps the official `--dsw-*` design tokens; L2 styles the semantic attributes (`data-dsh-surface` / `data-dsh-part` / `data-dsh-plugin`, enumeration in `contracts/semantic-attrs-v1.md`) which a compat adapter (`src/client/runtime/semantic-adapter.ts`) stamps onto the official shell DOM from stable anchors (`data-slot` outlets, `data-chat-flow-kind`, etc.); L3 patches carry any selector at the skin author's own risk. Plugins that output the semantic attributes themselves get the full L2 coverage; plugins that do not only get L1. A shared shell-rendering adapter applies only while a catalog skin, custom theme or wallpaper is active: it removes the workspace-list end fade, gives the composer placeholder an opaque theme-secondary text color, and reserves bottom clearance on conversation scrollports so messages remain readable above the sticky composer (#978), so individual skins do not need duplicate patches.
- Background priority: a Wallpaper Engine wallpaper always wins over the user manual background scrim, which wins over the skin's manifest background media; toggling the wallpaper re-evaluates the priority live.
- Background bridge (host-only): the host half keeps the background-scrim namespace, and the client keeps applying a persisted background occlusion/blur behind panels for skins that paint one. The management card itself renders no sliders.
- Wallpaper Engine bridge (host-only in this build): the host half (`src/we-library.ts` + `src/we-routes.ts`) locates the machine's local Wallpaper Engine library and serves it as the GUI backdrop (Steam app 431960: registry, every path in `libraryfolders.vdf`, durable `appmanifest_431960.acf` ownership, and probe paths on Windows), scans its projects and workshop content plus optional manual folders, and serves the inventory, media (Range-streamed), previews, web-wallpaper project files (with the WE API shim injected), and scene main-texture PNGs (decoded in-process from PKG/TEX by `src/pkg-extract.ts`, cached on disk) through same-origin `/api/skin-center/we/*` routes. Video wallpapers render in a `<video>`, web wallpapers in a sandboxed `<iframe>`, scene wallpapers live in the built-in WebGL player (2D layered scenes and 3D model scenes replayed with WE material/shader semantics); scene-embedded scripts are ignored while supported image, reflection, water and particle passes remain live, and a "static frame" render mode pins a zero-animation-cost image for any type. Per-wallpaper Import copies the project into `<harness-home>/skin-center/wallpapers/` so it survives Steam library changes, with update detection against the workshop original. Wallpapers are the user's own local files and are never uploaded or redistributed — Workshop content belongs to its authors. The Manual folders row accepts loose `.mp4`/`.webm` media, one project, a project collection, a Wallpaper Engine install root, or a Steam library root (`~` expands to the home directory).
- Legacy migration: on the first boot after the v2 upgrade, a one-shot bridge (`src/legacy-bridge.ts`) reads the retired `dsh-skin` managed section from the harness home `cordis.patch.yml` (where the v1 CLI wrote it; the active profile's `cordis.patch.yml` is probed as a secondary location), migrates the active skin id into the v2 selection store, and strips the legacy rows. The migration is idempotent and fails closed (the old state stays untouched on any error). It logs only when it migrated, cleaned, or failed — the nothing-to-migrate steady state stays silent (issue #788).

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @linxin666/dsh-client-ui-skin-center
# From the repo (dev): dsh plugin --profile web add link:$(pwd)/packages/skins/skin-center
```

`$(pwd)` is your clone of the dsh-web monorepo. The package ships no skins: **Whale Song (鲸吟)** lives in its own skin repository ([znc15/dsh-skin-whale-song](https://github.com/znc15/dsh-skin-whale-song)) — clone or copy it into `$DSH_HOME/skins/whale-song/` (its README has the exact commands; it ships a provenance file so the favicon hook stays trusted). A fresh install seeds whale-song as the default once when it is present and no selection was persisted; with no user skins installed the GUI keeps the official stock look.

skin-center is a self-contained bundle meeting the official DSH plugin standard (`dsh.bundle.patch` points to `cordis.patch.yml`); it can also be installed via git: `dsh plugin --profile web add github:<org>/dsh-web#<sha>` (the `prepare` script builds `lib/` in place). pnpm ≥10 requires authorizing `allowBuilds` before installing a git dependency; a local `link:` install has no such requirement.

## Configuration

- **Enable switch**: turns the whole card (try-on / apply / background controls) on or off; persisted in the v2 active-state document.
- **Background persistence (remote-capable)**: background values live in the v2 active-state document (`$DSH_HOME/skin-center-active.json`, the `background` section) and are read/written through `GET|POST /api/skin-center/v2/active`, so paired remote desktops — where the settings scope is loopback-only — load and keep them across sessions. The legacy `skin-background` settings namespace remains as the official settings page's input face: a customized section is migrated into the v2 store once at boot, and later page edits are forwarded by the client. Card edits do not write back to `settings.yaml`, so the settings page may show stale values until its next edit.
- **Wallpaper bridge (host)**: the host half persists wallpaper selections in the `skin-wallpaper` namespace and skin switches still clear a persisted selection; the card itself deliberately renders no wallpaper panel.
- **User skin directory**: `$DSH_HOME/skins/<id>/`; override precedence is `DSH_SKINS_HOME`, then `DSH_SKINS_DIR`, then `$DSH_HOME/skins`.

## Security model

- All `/api/skin-center/*` routes are same-origin only: writes reject cross-site requests (Sec-Fetch-Site / Origin fence), and asset reads are contained inside each skin directory (path escapes fail closed).
- Skin CSS is sanitized (whitelist) before serving; `patches.css` (L3) is arbitrary CSS by design and disclosed as such — it runs with full page styling power and is not a security boundary.
- `hooks.mjs` is trusted code that shares this repository's review and release; it is served same-origin only and its import/apply errors can never take the static skin down. Hooks run for built-in skins, and for user-directory skins installed from the official DSH Market whose `dsh-market.provenance.json` sha256-pins the on-disk `skin.json` and hooks entry to the market-served bytes (verified by `src/provenance.ts`, issue #1073); a missing or mismatched provenance — hand-dropped or tampered directories — keeps the hooks facet refused while the declarative parts still load.

## Known limitations

- Inline styles written by plugins at runtime can only be overridden by L3 `!important` patches.
- Plugins that do not output semantic attributes (and have no stable DOM anchors) receive L1 token coverage only.
- A skin video background keeps playing regardless of the wallpaper pause-on-hidden setting; pause-on-hidden applies to the Wallpaper Engine bridge only.

## Telemetry

The browser half sends one anonymous install heartbeat per UTC day to dsh-market.com: a random localStorage id plus this package's name, nothing else. The server stores only a salted hash of that id, never IP addresses, and exposes aggregate counts only. See [docs/telemetry.md](../../../docs/telemetry.md) for the full contract.

## Acceptance checklist

- [x] The skin-center section appears in 设置 → 皮肤中心 without console errors
- [x] The card shows the official default plus Whale Song; the active one is marked; invalid skins surface as diagnostics
- [x] Try-on takes effect immediately and Exit restores the committed skin; only one skin is ever on the page
- [x] One-click apply switches atomically with no reload; a later page load boots straight into the skin (no FOUC)
- [x] The light/dark theme toggle switches the official theme instantly
- [x] The Wallpaper Engine bridge and background scrim are unaffected by skin switches
