/**
 * Official-market provenance verification (issue #1073).
 *
 * Skins installed one-click from the DSH Market carry a
 * dsh-market.provenance.json written by the market installer at install
 * time, pinning every installed file to its sha256 and to the market
 * origin. The market's skin content is built from THIS repository (same
 * review, same release), so when the on-disk skin.json and hooks entry
 * hash-match the provenance, the hooks bytes are exactly the reviewed
 * bytes and may run like a built-in skin's.
 *
 * Fail-closed: a missing/unparseable provenance, a foreign source, or any
 * hash mismatch (post-install tampering, partial copy) keeps the
 * hooks-refused behavior for user-directory skins. Forging the provenance
 * requires write access to $DSH_HOME itself — an attacker with that access
 * can already install full plugins, so the file is a provenance record,
 * not a capability guard against the local user.
 * @module @linxin666/dsh-client-ui-skin-center/provenance
