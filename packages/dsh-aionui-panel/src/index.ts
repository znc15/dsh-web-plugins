 * What remains is the 'aionui-panel' settings namespace: the browser
 * side-card card binds it as its availability anchor, and keeping the
 * deprecated rightPanel field in the schema lets existing settings
 * documents keep validating. Its value is ignored everywhere.
 *
 * AionUi right-panel design (Apache-2.0, iOfficeAI/AionUi) — re-implemented
 * from measured behavior and architecture, not copied code.
