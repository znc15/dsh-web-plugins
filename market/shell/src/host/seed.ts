panel in the sidebar is where that choice is made, and where you can watch the
machine and type at it.

- reading, writing, searching, and editing files
- taking files in and out of the tab, through the Files panel

- Node, npm, Python, or a shell — this session has none; the emulated machine

The agent and the terminal share this directory: a file either of them creates,

Things that work here:

- reading, writing, searching, and editing files
- Node and npm — install a package from the registry and import it
- a shell for running them, and the common file commands

Things that do not:

- native toolchains (a compiler, python, a system package manager)
- listening on a port, or reaching a host that refuses cross-origin reads
